# Class 01: Introduction to Nodes, Edges, and Graphs Using LangChain  

Welcome to the first session of the LangChain Ecosystem series! ðŸš€  

This repository contains the code and resources from our **Class 01** video, where we explored the foundational concepts of **Nodes, Edges, and Graphs** using LangChain.  

## Overview  
In this session, you will learn:  
1. **Nodes:** The building blocks of graphs.  
2. **Edges:** Relationships that connect nodes.  
3. **Graphs:** How to represent and visualize interconnected data.  
4. **LangChain Ecosystem:** Introduction to its graph-based approach for AI applications.
