# LangChain Academy  

Welcome to **LangChain Academy**, your one-stop resource for mastering the LangChain Ecosystem!  

## Overview  

LangChain Academy is designed to help developers build intelligent applications using **LangChain** and its complementary tools. This repository is part of a structured course focused on creating **agent** and **multi-agent** applications with a framework called **LangGraph**.  

LangGraph is a separate framework built by LangChain to provide better precision and control in agent workflows, making it suitable for real-world complex systems.  

## Course Structure  

The repository is organized into modules, each focusing on specific themes within the **LangChain Ecosystem**:  

- **Modules:** Contain detailed Jupyter notebooks with explanations and sample code.  
- **Studio Folder:** Includes graphs that can be loaded into [LangGraph Studio](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph-studio) for interactive experimentation.  
- **Video Walkthroughs:** Accompanying videos that explain concepts step-by-step.
